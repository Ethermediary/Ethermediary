deal informations and certify that the deal is effectively successfull.
=> The Seller receive the "successDeal.dust" email. It contains a review of the

If the Buyer do not receive the object, the deal remains active. One month before
the "ice age" of the deal (365 days), before all the funds could be retrieved:
=> The Buyer/Seller receive the "revivalDeal.dust" email. It contains a review of the
deal informations and inform the Buyer/Seller that the deal will soon be frozen. The
Buyer/Seller is invited to make a cancelation request to the other one via a cancelation
request url.

    If the Buyer/Seller make a cancelation request before the end of the deal:
    => The Seller/Buyer receive the "cancelRequestDeal.dust" email, It contains a
    review of the deal informations and inform the Seller/Buyer that the other one
    made a cancelation request. The Seller/Buyer is invited to respond via a link
    to the web interface. It is reminded that, if the deal is not successfull or
    canceled, the funds will remain frozen and will never be retrivable to both of them.

    if the Seller/buyer accept to cancel the deal.
    => They both receive the "cancelSuccess.dust". It contains a review of the deal
    informations and inform the Seller/Buyer that the deal has been successfully
    canceled. Everybody get refunded and get his money back.

    If the Buyer/Seller refuse the cancelation request before the end of the deal:
    => The Seller/Buyer receive the "cancelRefusedDeal.dust" email, It contains a
    review of the deal informations and inform the Seller/Buyer that the other one
    refused the cancelation request. A cancelation request link is still provided.
    It is reminded that, if the deal is not successfull or canceled, the funds will
    remain frozen and will never be retrivable to both of them.

If 365 days ellapsed, and the deal is neither successfull nor canceled:
=> The Seller/buyer receive the "frozenDeal.dust" email. It contains a review of
the deal informations and inform the Seller/Buyer that the deal is now frozen and
that the funds could not be retreived, ever.
!!! This is not supposed to append ! It is actually here to motivate the seller
and the buyer to finalized the deal and to make cheating a non profitable behavior !!!
It is therefore better to cancel the deal, for both of them, rather than waiting for
something until the end of the deal.
